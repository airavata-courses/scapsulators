# Scapsulators
Spring 2022 Project


## Functionality/Motivation

1. Deployed the Custos architecture on [jetstream](js-168-203.jetstream-cloud.org).

2. Created a basic wrapper Flask application based on the Custos [Python SDK](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CUSTOS/PEARC21%3ACustos+SDK+Hands-On+Exercises).

3. Performed load testing of our deployed architecture using JMeter as part of the final assignment.


## Implementation Status

The services use `REST` for synchronous requests.

The app has been containerized with a gunicorn wsgi server having 2 workers for better local load-balancing.
