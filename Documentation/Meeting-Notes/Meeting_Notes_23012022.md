### Meeting Notes - 23rd Jan, 2022: 

### Discussion : 
1) We discussed the use case of our application and our initial plan is to create a weather report for identifying anomalies in the weather at a particular instant in time in the past. Our application will be used by meteorologists, weather enthusiast, geologists and marine biologists.
   The user can analyse and identify any anomalies in weather parameters through our GIF. Currently we are focussing on the below parameters : 
   i)   Reflectivity, 
   ii)  Spectrum width, 
   iii) Velocity 
2) We have come up with the basic layout of a Napkin diagram for our application.
3) In the login page, we have planned to add the 'Forgot Password' feature which allows the user to reset the password with a security question.
4) Good to have feature - Provide the weather report for a default location of the user when he/she logs in. 
5) Allocated tasks to each individual in the team based on their programming language preferences.




### Action Items : 
1) Research what Reflectivity, Spectrum width, and Velocity mean and how can it be related to the weather predictions.
2) What to write in the tool tip which will help the users understand the parameters we will be showing in our front end.
3) Build on the current basic layout of the Napkin diagram.
4) Analyze the station data to figure out how to populate the front end input search for the user.
5) Research on the most efficient way to break down our application into various microservices and how to optimize the design of the number of microservices and purpose of every microservice.
6) Complete the deadline field in the Task allocation excel sheet for respective tasks.
   Rough draft of timeline : 
   24th to 29th Jan    - Complete all the development and implementation of microservices and front end. (Including documentation as and when necessary)
   30th Jan            - Buffer Day
   31st Jan to 4th Feb - Peer Testing and CI/CD Integration
